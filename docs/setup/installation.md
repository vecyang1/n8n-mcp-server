npm run build

# Optional: Install globally

```

## Verifying Installation

Once installed, you can verify the installation by running:

```bash
n8n-mcp-server --version
```

This should display the version number of the installed n8n MCP Server.

2. Run the server
3. Register the server with your AI assistant platform
